## Work at Microsoft

The bulk of my time at Microsoft was spent working on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager. I was responsible for much of the AKS documentation and all of the Fleet Manager documentation, but a few standout 
pages include: 

* [Supported Kubernetes versions in AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli)
* [Update Kubernetes and node images across multiple clusters using Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/update-orchestration?tabs=azure-portal)
* [AKS baseline for multiregion clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-multi-region/aks-multi-cluster)


## Older work

* [Building a natural language processing application with LUIS.ai and Python](https://github.com/Nickomang/luispython)
