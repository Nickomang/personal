This post is written in **MDX**. You can still use regular Markdown syntax, like lists:

- One thing
- Another thing
- With a <a href="/blog">link</a> in it.

And you can also use inline JSX-style components:

<Callout>
  This is a simple MDX callout box rendered as a component. 
</Callout>

```ts
// Code blocks still work as usual
const msg: string = "Hello from MDX!";
console.log(msg);
