Path of Exile 2 recently released the 0.4 patch, Fate of the Vaal, and I'm a big fan. A lot of depth was added to the game through the new classes and crafting mechanics, and in my opinion the temple is both fun and rewarding.
As always, the patch also came with a slew of new unique items, including this one:

I'm a big fan of staves, so I wanted to take the time to write a review of the item and talk a bit about the state of Unique staves in PoE2.


# General staff observations

# How do unique staves compare to their archetype?

Substantial buffs to modifier values have resulted in rare staves becoming the most popular weapon in the game, with a massive 31% of characters level 90 or above using one. Compare this to the following breakdown:

|Item|Usage|
|---|---|
|The Burden of Shadows|1.0%|
|Whispering Ice|1.0%|
|The Unborn Lich|0.5%|
|Atziri's Rule|0.1%|

<br/>

Not much usage. Whispering Ice has enough utility that I think it's genuinely underplayed. The Burden of Shadows has always been unpopular despite its power. The Unborn Lich is a complex build-around, and 
only a single variant. Finally, we have Atziri's Rule, which is both new and not obviously powerful.

## Why do they see such little use?

In my opinion, there are three major parts to this- 

1. The unique staves were always unpopular, despite being equally if not more viable in previous patches.
2. Modifier values on rare staves have been buffed, while unique staves have not been buffed enough to compensate.
3. Gem Levels are still king, meaning any staff without them has to work much harder

The main takeaway from this patch is that for a Unique staff to become competitive, it has to overcome an even stronger set of bonuses than it did previously. The unique aspects of the item need to be very compelling in order
to cause players to drop rare staves with 200% increased spell damage, 120% damage gained as extra, and +7 gem levels. Looking back at Atziri's Rule, we see reasonable numbers, but not quite up to par with what a rare can bring. 


# Individual reviews

## Whispering ice

Not viable to build around the skill, but has some fantastic utility. Should probably be run in the 2nd weapon slot of a lot more builds now that it applies elemental exposure instead of just cold. 

## The Burden of Shadow

I have a hunch that this is still a powerhouse if you can build around it correctly. I haven't tried since 0.1, but it was extremely strong back then. It was trivial to get north of 300% added chaos dmg (eclipsing anything on a rare staff), and I'm sure with all the new power in the game you can push it much further.

## Unborn Lich

The Unborn Lich could rise in popularity due to the discovery of new successful variations, but for now, the vast majority of players are using the variant with *His Scattering Calamity* on a Titan.

## Atziri's Rule

My take on this was a Disciple of Varashta using frostbolt for clear. It functioned well in maps but unfortunately suffers from the same numbers problem the other unique staves do, putting a lot of pressure on the Mirror 
of Refraction to carry the build. I'm sad to say, it does not. As we move while clearing, mirrors tend to spawn in useless locations, and there's no single target utility at all. It's fun to see a lot of frostbolts on the screen and it's viable for t15 maps,
but ultimately it's not very good. 


# An example of success

Atziri's Contempt, on the other hand, is an example of a spear where the raw numbers are pretty compelling, but still lag behind what a rare can bring. The ability is required to bring a lot to the table, and boy, does it. Shattering Spite is extremely fun
to both play and build around, and it provides satisfying clear and single target all in one skill.
